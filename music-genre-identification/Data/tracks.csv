<p>""This is the first album I wish to be remembered by. Recorded through a bleak year of my life, 2006, Boss of Goth is an album of power-mourning, demon-fighting and vengeance-fucking. Trapped inside despair over the death of true love, childhood, and joy, I have always clung voraciously to a promise of a better tomorrow. I finished this album in March of 2007 and held on to it until now to make sure I would still love it enough to make 500 of them.<br /><br />Boss of Goth includes industrial punk and pop style songs with occasional fleeting dance beats and bursts of harsh noise. Vocals are the central focus, creating sweet pop ballads and lurking creep-stalker punk melt-downs. A variety of microphone processing accompanying sequencers, drum machines, and tons and tons of manipulated cassette tapes. Twisted collage journeys and quick punches to the throat. A fitting comparison perhaps: To Live and Shave in LA meets Nine Inch Nails, with the spirits of Edward Ka-Spel, Suckdog, and bedroom four track. Includes 6 songs that have appeared regularly in live performances. Oh yeah, and I play piano on the last track.<br /><br />Album includes two hidden bonus tracks. The first a live performance caught at the end of my ""temper tantrum approach"" to harsh noise performance.

<p>""This is the first album I wish to be remembered by. Recorded through a bleak year of my life, 2006, Boss of Goth is an album of power-mourning, demon-fighting and vengeance-fucking. Trapped inside despair over the death of true love, childhood, and joy, I have always clung voraciously to a promise of a better tomorrow. I finished this album in March of 2007 and held on to it until now to make sure I would still love it enough to make 500 of them.<br /><br />Boss of Goth includes industrial punk and pop style songs with occasional fleeting dance beats and bursts of harsh noise. Vocals are the central focus, creating sweet pop ballads and lurking creep-stalker punk melt-downs. A variety of microphone processing accompanying sequencers, drum machines, and tons and tons of manipulated cassette tapes. Twisted collage journeys and quick punches to the throat. A fitting comparison perhaps: To Live and Shave in LA meets Nine Inch Nails, with the spirits of Edward Ka-Spel, Suckdog, and bedroom four track. Includes 6 songs that have appeared regularly in live performances. Oh yeah, and I play piano on the last track.<br /><br />Album includes two hidden bonus tracks. The first a live performance caught at the end of my ""temper tantrum approach"" to harsh noise performance. The second is Dragging an Ox Through Water (aka Brian Mumford) singing a cover of my song ""Save Life's Golden Receipt in Case Refund Needed."" Both were recorded at Someday Lounge by Ryan Olson.<br /><br />CD comes with a 12 page booklet with lyrics.

Originally released as a limited vinyl edition by Simonson himself, Little Eyes blew even his revered ESP side to ribbons and stands as one of the most magical outsider/freak artefacts to ever escape the prodigious gravity of the decade in which it was birthed. Askew has a highly idiosyncratic vocal style that is equal parts quizzical bubble-gum chewing kind on shrooms and doe-eyed real people Richard Brautigan character. Perhaps the closest comparison would be to Tom Rapp or Judee Sill‚Äôs old buddy Tommy Peltier. His instrumental conceptions certainly owe a massive debt to Dylan circa 64/65 - who the fuck didn‚Äôt - especially his spine-tingling harmonica work but it‚Äôs the beautiful arc of the songs that will keep you coming back, the way he combines rough, fluffed performances with eye-watering lyrical sentiments, heartbreaking phrasing and weird, clunky chords played on a ‚ÄòMartin tiple‚Äô. If you ever dug the whole late-60s freak-folk fall-out as documented by Pearls Before Swine, Bleib Alien, Tim Buckley, Fugs, Roots Of Madness et al you are gonna crease. Simply put, one of the most beautifully cracked singer-songwriter albums of a timeless age. Only the hardest of hearts could resist it. -<i><span>All text copyright  ¬© David Keenan/Volcanic Tongue</span></i></p>",1,11/26/08 2:08,7,127,40.7143528,"New York, NY",-74.0059731,,Ed Askew,,['ed askew'],http://www.facebook.com/ecaskew?v=feed ,,training,small,256000,0,,11/26/08 1:48,,230,2,Folk,[17],[17],,2299,en,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 International,551,,15,,[],When I Arive
213,0,11/26/08 1:53,7/5/07 0:00,,1,86,"<p>""It took me exactly six months from the day of its release to begin writing about Au‚Äôs self-titled ‚Äúdebut‚Äù album. Despite the crippling procrastination that plagues most Tiny Mix Tapes reviewers (okay, just me, but I am not averse to dragging my superior wordsmiths into my wading pool of incompetence), I am genuinely surprised at my lack of motivation and overall laxness in penning this one. It‚Äôs not like the album hasn‚Äôt gaily danced its way into my pleasure center and taken up residence in my hypothalamus during the past few months or anything! <br />Au (‚Äúay-yoo‚Äù) is primarily Luke Wyland, a musically promiscuous Portlander who in 2005 released peaofthesea under the simple handle ‚Äúluc.‚Äù Some of Au will appeal tremendously to those longing for Sung Tongs-era Animal Collective. Opening track ‚ÄúBoute,‚Äù in particular, recalls that same exciting positive folk feel that Messrs. Tare and Bear practice when the mood strikes them. ‚ÄúSum‚Äù is just as thrilling; after an intro of tinkles and strums, the song starts in earnest around 0:43 with a mix of banjo, Zo√´ Wright‚Äôs dreamy vocals, and then a full muddled arsenal of rattles and clangs as it quickly builds a sound drift of intoxicating proportions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShelter‚Äù is a quiet dazzler that thrashes together two important sections of Wyland‚Äôs creative CV: his childhood classical piano education and his avant-garde work. It is a lovely piece of vocal-splicing and piano- and sleighbell-abetted drone that runs a course without any real end goal. In fact, it doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere at all, but it feels wonderful getting there. Elsewhere, without hinging on any major sensational events, Au reveals itself slowly, subtly, and satisfyingly. ‚ÄúDeath,‚Äù which features vocal help from A Weather‚Äôs Sarah Winchester that actually sounds like creeping death, starts a dark troika from cleanup to sixth in Au‚Äôs batting order. After this bout of introspection comes the meditative exercise ‚ÄúLife‚Äù and ‚ÄúAsk the River,‚Äù closing the album with a discharge of freshly-plucked notes.</p>
<p>Maybe it is not entirely my fault that I sat on this album a little longer than I would have preferred. It would be easy to disregard this li‚Äôl slip of an album if it were not for the music it contains. With a non-descript, hand-drawn cover and very little fanfare trumpeted by my beloved Rolling Stone and Spin (joking), Au perhaps suffers from underexposure, which is a shame because it would take a malcontent of the highest order to find many faults with this superb example of modern songwriting. While comparisons can be made to other forward-thinking acts, Au genuinely feels like a blank slate record: it is devoid of many thoughts of the past, instead relying on painting little, unique pictures with sounds. It has the feel of a ‚Äúgraphic score‚Äù rather than an album. In musical notation, Au is all warm wingdings.</p>
<p>The whole album soundtracks a stimulating encounter between song and sound. At times haunting and morose, at other times uplifting, Au is a mixed bag with plenty of tasty tricks. Rather than patching things together like a weekend carpenter in a vain effort to make a million things ‚Äúfit,‚Äù Wyland employs the skills of a seasoned curry cook, sprinkling in a measured variety of sonic concepts like garam masala into the finest of dishes. Wyland and his Au collaborators have produced an accomplished and commendable album. Dig in and dig often."" -Tiny Mix Tapes (http://aagoo.bigcartel.com/product/au-au)</p>",1148,,[],Au,1,Single Tracks,1/1/05 0:00,,"Aagoo, Oedipus, Popfrenzy, Inpartmaint","<p><span style=""font-family:Verdana, Geneva, Arial;font-size:xx-small;"">AU is the work of multi-instrumentalist Luke Wyland. Begun back in 2005 while finishing up his degree from the Massachussetts College of Art and moved  across the country to find its roots in the thriving community of Portland, OR. It's now a  working live band with an ever changing roster of players that currently includes Dana Vlatka on drums (Jackie-O_Motherfucker, Mustaphamond)- and has been blessed by the  help of Jonathan Sielaff (Parenthetical Girls, Nick Jaina), Mark Kaylor (Hamor of Hathor, CexFucx), Becky Dawson (Saw Whet, Ah Holly Fam'ly) and Sarah Winchester (A Weather) on it's recordings.
